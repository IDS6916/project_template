## Topic/Purpose Statement

“This study addresses” the viability of using computer simulations to identify the relationship between transportation networks and the smuggling of illicit antiquities. “The purpose of this research” is to provide a tool for law enforcement agencies and cultural heritage workers to recover looted archaeological artifacts before they reach the black market for sale. “The first phase” of the study will be a quantitative simulation, guided by graph theory, to determine the various routes between [How many?] archaeological sites that are known to have been looted during the 2014 ISIS insurgency in Syria and Iraq and known locations where caches of illicit artifacts have been recovered. The data from these [simulations] will inform a qualitative survey designed to explore the routes that participants will select when informed about transportation networks and faction controlled territories [THIS ISNT QUITE RIGHT].

## General Introduction

Throughout the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, organized criminal gangs have taken advantage of political instability to loot archaeological sites for the purpose of selling illicit antiquities to fund political insurgency and terrorist organizations (Terrill, 2007). While looting in these areas is a centuries-old practice (Luke & Kersel, 2005), advances in technology and a growing demand for antiquities from this region has caused a dramatic increase in these activites (Terrill, 2007).  

During the insurgency of Syria and Iraq by ISIS in 2014, the terrorist organization often televised the systematic destruction of what they termed “idolatrous” heritage. Using this as justification for the destruction of cultural heritage sites in the region, ISIS quietly looted these sites prior to their televised destruction, with the funds gained on the black market used to further support their effort (Terrill 2017). During this same time period, ISIS routinely issued permits to groups in the areas under their control, allowing for the looting of archaeological and cultural heritage sites, with the permittees sharing a portion of the black market profits with ISIS in exchange for the right to keep some of the profits for themselves. The looting of these sites and the subsequent improvements to structures in the areas bordering the sites has been observed through satellite analysis of the locations (Casana, 2015; Parcak, 2013). In the intervening years, while the presence of ISIS in the region has been marginalized, the looting of archaeological sites continues in the destabilized region (CITE). Oftentimes, the looting of these resources is not known until months after the fact, often seen by satellite imagery or when locals discuss their activities with archaeologists returning to some of the affected areas to continue their research (Casana, 2015; Proulx, 2013). 

The duel impact of the loss of cultural heritage and the monies gained from their sale are motivation to find methods to intercept stolen antiquities before they reach the black market. Understanding the methods of transportation that these groups utilize is essential to understanding how they are moving these goods from the initial archaeological sites, through the countries, across the borders, and into safe houses where they could be held for decades before they are sold. 

Computer simulations offer an option for this research. By first understanding the transportation options available to smugglers, simulations can be informed [following the principles of graph theory] which can provide reliable insight on the routes that smugglers would select when transporting illicit antiquities away from looted archaeological sites. Research into transnational smuggling indicates that when transporting illicit goods, smugglers will often select one of two methods, to either hide in plain sight or to move with stealth (Basu, 2013; Basu, 2014). Following the idea that smugglers will act as normal citizens when they travel (Basu, 2014) this project has several aims, first to use computer simulations to identify travel routes from known looted archaeological sites to locations where caches of illicit goods have been recovered, to then use this data to administer a qualitative survey to better understand which paths a “normal citizen” [DEFINE] would prefer to travel when informed of road conditions, faction-control of roads, and available alternative routes, and, finally, to then use the data gained from these surveys to gauge how accurately a simulation will select the same routes, given the same information (How are we doing this part?). In an attempt to aid cultural heritage workers, international NGO's, and local stakeholders, this project seeks to address this problem through the use of computer simulations based upon in-country transportation networks to illuminate the relationship between this infrastructre and the paths that criminals would use to transport stolen antiquities from archaeological sites. We believe this project will provide proof of concept that computer simulations can reliably predict the routes that smugglers would select when they choose to hide in plain sight. 
 
Hypotheses:

H1: The incorporation of regional variables (weather, faction-control, road conditions, available alternative routes) will improve the prediciton of smuggling routes. 

H2: Identifying routes of least resistance through weighting roads based on informed criteria (faction-control, road conditions, available alternative routes) will result in reliable transportation models for smuggling illicit antiquities, based upon the theory that smugglers aim to blend in with the populous.

H3: Computer simulations will select the same preferred routes as informed survey participants.

## Related Work

  One obstacle for predicting the routes that looters take while transporting goods away from archeological sites is understanding how the political or geographical conditions of a region could influence the routing decisions made by smugglers. While looting in the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region deserves unique considerations because of the activity’s relationship to terrorist groups, certain behaviors might hold true  across regions (Proulx, 2013).  From this perspective, understanding looting behavior at a global level could serve to inform our model for looting in the MENA region. 
  
  There is some anecdotal evidence to suggests that looters often do not take precautions to avoid detection by archeologists or law officials after they have stolen historical goods (Proulx, 2013). In this study on regional attitudes towards looting,  Proulx (2013) found that the majority of archeological field-workers come into contact with looters while working. Further, nearly half of these field-workers have been solicited by looters to purchase back stolen goods. Data from this study was aggregated from historical sites located broadly throughout the world, which provides some insight on looting activity in MENA. However, this study does not help to explain routing behavior that is dependent on border customs and region-specific faction politics.

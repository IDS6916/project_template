## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

(I tell sutdents to answer the questions, one paragaph each to start if you are lost)

(Problem Statement. One paragraph to describe the prob-lem that you are tackling.)

Research Problem: Understanding how organized gangs of looters transport illicit antiquities from archaeological sites.

Research Question: How can transportation simulations illuminate the relationship between existing transportation infrastructure and the paths criminals would use to transport stolen antiquities?

Sub-questions:
a) Can studying the routes that are generated through simulations be used to predict the routes of smugglers?

b) What decision-making criteria would smugglers use to determine the most viable routes for transporting illicit goods?

c) Can a country's predisposition to bribing the police force alter the routes that smugglers may take?

d) Can simulations incorporate variables, such as corruption, knowledge of faction-controlled roadways and borders, and vehicle capabilities, to create accurate transportation models?

Background/Historical Context: 
Throughout the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, organized criminal gangs have taken advantage of political instability to loot archaeological sites for the purpose of selling illicit antiquities to fund political insurgency and terrorist organizations (Terrill, 2007). While looting in these areas is a centuries-old practice (Luke & Kersel, 2005), advances in technology and a growing demand for antiquities from this region has caused a dramatic increase in these activites (Terrill, 2007). In an attempt to aid cultural heritage workers, international NGO's, and local stakeholders, this project seeks to address this problem through the use of computer simulations based upon in-country transportation networks to illuminate the relationship between this infrastructre and the paths that criminals would use to transport stolen antiquities from archaeological sites.  


(Motivation. Why is this problem interesting and relevant to the research community?)

(Proposed Solution. How do we propose to tackle this problem (that has been identified in the previous para-graphs, is interesting to the community, and has yet to be tackled by other researchers)?)

(Contributions. An enumeration of the contributions of the senior design project)

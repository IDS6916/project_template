## Topic/Purpose Statement

“This study addresses” the viability of using computer simulations to identify the relationship between transportation networks and the smuggling of illicit antiquities. “The purpose of this research” is to provide a tool for law enforcement agencies and cultural heritage workers to recover looted archaeological artifacts before they reach the black market for sale. “The first phase” of the study will be a quantitative simulation, guided by graph theory, to determine the various routes between [How many?] archaeological sites that are known to have been looted during the 2014 ISIS insurgency in Syria and Iraq and known locations where caches of illicit artifacts have been recovered. The data from these [simulations] will inform a qualitative survey designed to explore the routes that participants will select when informed about transportation networks and faction controlled territories [THIS ISNT QUITE RIGHT].

## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

(I tell students to answer the questions, one paragaph each to start if you are lost)

(Problem Statement. One paragraph to describe the prob-lem that you are tackling.)

Research Problem: Understanding how organized gangs of looters transport illicit antiquities from archaeological sites.

Research Question: How can transportation simulations illuminate the relationship between existing transportation infrastructure and the paths criminals would use to transport stolen antiquities?

Sub-questions:
a) Can studying the routes that are generated through simulations be used to predict the routes of smugglers?

b) What decision-making criteria would smugglers use to determine the most viable routes for transporting illicit goods?

c) Can a country's predisposition to bribing the police force alter the routes that smugglers may take?

d) Can simulations incorporate variables, such as corruption, knowledge of faction-controlled roadways and borders, and vehicle capabilities, to create accurate transportation models?

Background/Historical Context: 
Throughout the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, organized criminal gangs have taken advantage of political instability to loot archaeological sites for the purpose of selling illicit antiquities to fund political insurgency and terrorist organizations (Terrill, 2007). While looting in these areas is a centuries-old practice (Luke & Kersel, 2005), advances in technology and a growing demand for antiquities from this region has caused a dramatic increase in these activites (Terrill, 2007). In an attempt to aid cultural heritage workers, international NGO's, and local stakeholders, this project seeks to address this problem through the use of computer simulations based upon in-country transportation networks to illuminate the relationship between this infrastructre and the paths that criminals would use to transport stolen antiquities from archaeological sites.  


(Motivation. Why is this problem interesting and relevant to the research community?)

(Proposed Solution. How do we propose to tackle this problem (that has been identified in the previous para-graphs, is interesting to the community, and has yet to be tackled by other researchers)?)

(Contributions. An enumeration of the contributions of the senior design project)

## Related Work

  One obstacle for predicting the routes that looters take while transporting goods away from archeological sites is understanding how the political or geographical conditions of a region could influence the routing decisions made by smugglers. While looting in the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region deserves unique considerations because of the activity’s relationship to terrorist groups, certain behaviors might hold true  across regions (Proulx, 2013).  From this perspective, understanding looting behavior at a global level could serve to inform our model for looting in the MENA region. 
  
  There is some anecdotal evidence to suggests that looters often do not take precautions to avoid detection by archeologists or law officials after they have stolen historical goods (Proulx, 2013). In this study on regional attitudes towards looting,  Proulx (2013) found that the majority of archeological field-workers come into contact with looters while working. Further, nearly half of these field-workers have been solicited by looters to purchase back stolen goods. Data from this study was aggregated from historical sites located broadly throughout the world, which provides some insight on looting activity in MENA. However, this study does not help to explain routing behavior that is dependent on border customs and region-specific faction politics.
